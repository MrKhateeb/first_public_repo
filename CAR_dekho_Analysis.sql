#Let's say that it's not enough just to know aggregated stats by month. After all, there are a lot of months in this dataset. 
#Instead, you might want to find every month during which AAPL stock worked its way over $400/share. 
#The WHERE clause won't work for this because it doesn't allow you to filter on aggregate columnsâ€”that's where the HAVING clause comes in:

but this is also commonly done using a subquery, which you will learn about in a later lesson. */
